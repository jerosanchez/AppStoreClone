#  README

A simple app to show case a professional UIKit-based app.

This project has been inspired by Brian Voong's sample app in his _App Store_ paid course.

Although the idea has been borrowed from his sample app, this project includes a huge number of improvements and additions, such as a true SOLID architecture, unit and integration tests, dependency injection, implementation of cross-cutting concerns like proper logging, and much more.
